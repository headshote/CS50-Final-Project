usr,"Cold Feet is a British comedy-drama television series that ran from 1998 to 2003. It was created by Mike Bullen as a follow-up to his 1997 one-off comedy of the same name. The series, set and largely filmed in Greater Manchester, follows three couples experiencing the ups-and-downs of romance. Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley (James Nesbitt, pictured, and Helen Baxendale) are a new couple who go through dating, marriage and the birth of a child. Pete and Jenny Gifford (John Thomson and Fay Ripley) experience parenthood, adultery, separation and divorce. Karen and David Marsden (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) live an upper-middle-class lifestyle, but their marriage disintegrates after each has an affair. The show was a critical and ratings success. Critics analysed the depiction of social issues, the use of popular music, and the relevance of the series to contemporary audiences compared to big-budget BBC costume dramas. The series was a regular nominee at the British Comedy Award",28,3,2013,19,36,

Factors contributing to its cyclical and greatly exaggerated demise include rampant mobile game growth and declining subscriptions for MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) titles. Yet according to a new report commissioned by the PC Gaming Alliance, this slice of the industry grew 8% in 2012 with revenue of $20 billion.",28,3,2013,19,44,6.jpg
